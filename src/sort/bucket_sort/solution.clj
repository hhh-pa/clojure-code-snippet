;; bucket-sort: pure Clojure bucket sort.
;;
;; Distribute the values into one ordered bucket per element, sort
;; each bucket, and concatenate the buckets in order. Buckets stay
;; tiny on uniform input, so the average time is O(n); oversized
;; buckets fall back to a linearithmic sort, which keeps the worst
;; case at O(n log n). Space is O(n). Pure Clojure with no host
;; interop: persistent vectors, loop and recur, reduce where it fits.
;; Input and output match the shared sort driver contract: stdin
;; holds n followed by values, stdout is [v1,v2,...].
